# CMSC-15100-Project

This is the final project for my CMSC 15100 at the University of Chicago. This is a fully functional Backgammon game.It allows two humans to play the classic game of Backgammon using a mouth and keyboard. All rules of Backgammon, except a few esoteric ones, are implemented. 

As an enhancement, the program has the capability to save an in-progress game and then later load it back so it can be resumed:
* when `u` is pressed, the previous move is undone;
* when `s` is pressed, the current state of the game is saved;
* when `l` is pressed, the old games that was saved is loaded, and the current game is overriden.
